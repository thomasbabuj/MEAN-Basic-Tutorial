How AngularJS tries to alleivate code complexity and redability

1) Unit Testing:

	It decouples DOM manipulation from application logic. Data and dependencies are 
	*$inject* as needed.

2) Different browsers implements features differently, but AJ's directive (or HTML extensions) takecare of the differences

3) Global Namespace : 
	Expressions and method definations are scoped within controllers, so they do not pollute the global namespace.

4) Data models are plain old Javascript objects.	

5) AJ provides solution for writing modular code and dependencies management.
